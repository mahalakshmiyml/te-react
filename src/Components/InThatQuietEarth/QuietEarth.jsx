                      Total Environment In That Quiet Earth sits off Hennur Main
                      Road, in the fast developing North Bangalore area which
                      has not only emerged as an economic hub, but also as a
                      front-runner among self-contained suburbs that are great
                      places to live and work. The presence of good schools,
                      hospitals, malls, hotels and restaurants in the area and
                      easy access to the airport enhances its desirability.

                      In That Quiet Earth - Each home is designed to address the
                      needs of a high-quality contemporary lifestyle with a host
                      of innovative features, and can be customised to suit the
                      functional needs and aesthetic preferences of individual
                      families. Using our proprietary eDesign platform, you can
                      move walls, combine rooms, reconfigure layouts and
                      redesign almost every aspect of your home so that it is
                      just right for you.

                      The two bedroom home is designed around the concept of a
                      traditional Indian courtyard, with the living and dining
                      space and the bedrooms opening out towards a double height
                      garden and deck especially designed to house a full grown
                      small tree. Simple, clean lines and free flowing spaces
                      ensure that the interiors don’t feel dated after some
                      time. An open kitchen allows for conversations, and large
                      windows and French windows bring in plenty of natural
                      light. Earthy natural stone ooring and wood windows
                      provide the warmth that you can always expect from a
                      typical Total Environment home.

                      hold a full grown small tree, bringing nature into the
                      heart of the home.
