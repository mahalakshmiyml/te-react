              concept to completion. This high degree of interaction between our

              <strong>The Experience</strong> Our customers find in us a partner,
              who in a complete departure from the traditional industry
              perception, seeks to make the whole experience as warm and
              personal as the homes we deliver.

              <strong>Bringing The outdoors in</strong> A first-of-its kind
              innovation in residential real estate projects worldwide, in 1997
              we introduced the concept of cantilevered terrace gardens with
              every apartment. Since then this has become an integral part of
              all our projects. Our gardens have grown larger and now include
              features like water bodies and wood decks - bringing the outdoors
              in and taking the indoors out. Our projects are also noted for
              their creeper-covered pergolas and landscaping.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Customization</strong> We believe that we are perhaps the
              only firm in the country that allows home owners to customise
              every little detail of their homes. Our homeowners are encouraged
              to customise their homes to match their distinct tastes and
              lifestyles.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>eBuild: </strong> Our online proprietary tool helps you
              customise almost every aspect of your home. You can choose from a
              wide range of space layout options, styles, colours and themes.
              eBuild can even provide instant information on costs and
              feasibility. Our in-house consultants will guide and assist you
              during the process.

              <strong>
              Materials and Finishes:
              </strong> We are focused on creating physical environments that are in harmony with their surroundings. It is our attempt to give our buildings a character that is essentially grounded in nature. Our use of natural construction materials like wire-cut bricks and exposed form finished concrete, we believe, has added a new dimension to building aesthetics. Besides being maintenance-free, these materials age beautifully with time.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Our projects come with a host of technological features that have been introduced to truly enhance the quality of life of people who live in them. From the quality of finish to our RCC work, to the use of eBuild - our online tool to help customise your home, to the state-of-the-art home automation systems that make interaction with your home seamless and a pleasurable experience, technology is helping us deliver advanced homes of high quality, long life and efficiency.</p>
            <p><strong>In-house Construction Teams</strong> Doing everything in-house from start to handover and after, we are able to ensure quality and control costs: benefits that we pass on to our customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Quality</strong> It's not just in the sourcing of the best; it's also in how we labour over all aspects of our work - from design to workmanship - that sets us apart.</p>
            <p><strong>Transparency & Ethics :</strong> Our ability to keep things simple, transparent and above board has helped build the trust our customers place in us. We seek to develop relationships that are as enduring as our buildings. We keep a stream of honest and timely communication going with our customers, building bonds even as we build homes.</p>
