                      About Total Environment Pursuit Of A Radical Rhapsody
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Pursuit of a Radical Rhapsody is located on the edge of a
                      small lake in Whitefield - the IT hub of India’s Silicon
                      Valley, in the vicinity of the best international schools,
                      hospitals, malls and five-star hotels. Whitefield’s urbane
                      culture and lifestyle have made it home to well-traveled
                      professionals. Against the backdrop of Bangalore’s
                      glorious weather, this burgeoning suburb is one of the
                      best investment destinations in India.

                      PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN HARMONY WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                      Adjacent to the project is a small lake and the project
                      has been designed with a board walk along the lake. The
                      apartments at the lower level step back from the lake,
                      keeping the scale in mind. With tons of landscaping and
                      several hundred trees all over the campus, earth sheltered
                      roofs over the villas and terrace gardens with every
                      single home, we do expect the micro climate inside the
                      project to be a little better than outside and a reduction
                      in the “urban heat island effect”.
                    </p>

                    <h6>LIVING AREAS</h6>

                      gardens facing the lake, the L30 and L45 apartments have
                      been designed to house trees in their gardens, made
