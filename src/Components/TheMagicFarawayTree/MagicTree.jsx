                      About Total Environment The Magic Faraway Tree
                    </h2>
                    <p>Total Environment is focused on creating living spaces that are in harmony with their surroundings.<br />
The Magic Faraway Tree on the Kanakapura Main Road is spread over 12 acres. The property will have 434 residential apartments. Each home is custom designed and handcrafted to suit individual lifestyles, following the belief that not one size fits all. Every apartment has its own garden and open terrace, allowing ample light and ventilation.</p>
                    <p>The Magic Faraway Tree takes its name from the beautiful old tree on the edge of the property on Kanakapura Road, just 200 meters from the NICE corridor and adjacent to the upcoming Metro Station, well connected with Electronics City, Hosur Road, Bannerghatta Road as well as the Industrial areas of Peenya and Bidadi. The property is elevated, with greenery all around, overlooking small hillocks towards the south.</p>
                    <p>Phase II on the northern side of the property has 2 towers, with our C20 single level apartments and D35 duplex apartments, all in our very special Orange specifications, which include kitchen cabinetry with dishwasher, hob and chimney, beds, wardrobes and study tables. Each of these homes is also available in our Purple, Blue or Green specifications.
</p>
                    <p>The C20 home is designed as a simple “L” in plan, with 4 such homes placed back to back, forming a “plus” shape in a block. This unique layout coupled with large glass panels, offers clear unobstructed views of the outside, from every room and at the same time open out onto a landscaped terrace garden placed inside the L. The gardens run in alternate directions on alternate floors, for the required natural light.</p>
                    <p>These exceptional homes have been created for people who share our passion for design and quality. A host of innovative features have been introduced to create spaces that are smart and modern, yet warm and inviting.</p>
                    <p>The D35 duplex homes are the closest you can get to a bungalow on the ground.<br/>
Designed to wrap around a large garden, deck and waterbody, these homes are intimate and warm yet spacious and cheerful with large glass panels that bring in natural light.<br />
The upper level houses the master bedroom suite, complete with a walk-in wardrobe and a spacious bathroom overlooking the garden below. Also housed on this floor, are the children’s bedroom with attached bathroom, as well as a study and a family space which can easily convert into a fourth bedroom through our customisation process.</p>
<p>Warm, earthy materials, carefully crafted finishes, little details such as bathroom doors with glass and wood louvres, and the ability to customize every space to suit individual needs, make this a very special home.</p>
