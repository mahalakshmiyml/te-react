                    <p>
                      A traditional office is where you check in at 9, check out
                      at 5, and count the days to weekends and vacations. But it
                      doesn’t have to be that way. At Total Environment, we have
                      designed and delivered living spaces for 24 years, by
                      blurring the boundaries between the indoors and outdoors,
                      making living in our homes feel more like a resort
                      vacation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We apply the same philosophy to our workspaces by
                      embracing nature to bridge the gap between work and
                      vacation.

                      Introducing “WORKCATIONS” by Total Environment. Nature has

                      We channel this through good design and bring nature into
                      your professional lives. Enjoying the best of what nature
                      has to offer, does not have to be paused or postponed

                      Pursuit of a Radical Rhapsody Commercial is perfectly
                      located on the ITPL Main Road, close to residential
                      communities, schools, shopping centres, cultural hubs,
                      hospitals, restaurants & hotels. Efficient connectivity
                      and a well-developed social infrastructure have led to
                      this area becoming self-sufficient. Good employment
                      opportunities, coupled with a talent pool of highly
                      skilled manpower, has had a positive impact on the
                      residential and commercial real estate markets in
                      Whitefield, thereby making it a brand that many companies
                      want to be part of.
